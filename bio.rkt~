Repo means code repository and this is where coders
 will write their code and collaborate with other coders on it. 

Git is the technology that actually allows you to push code and collaborate with others. 
 
Github is one of the websites where you can push your repositories for them to be
editted by other coders worldwide.

Git is usally taught to CS students in their 4th year to improve their collaboration
in a class called software engineering

Coaches learn git early because it allows for collaboration at all stages of code.
