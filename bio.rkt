 #:coach-story "Hi there, my name is Juliette Langari and my story actually has nothing to do with coding;
instead, its about horseback riding and coding my brain. So back when I was about 6 or 7 I was really intrigued
by horses, my mom decided to sign me up for lessons and as soon as I jumped on the horse I realized I knew nothing.
For some reason I thought it would just come naturally but I didnt know how to go forward, or stop, or turn.
It seemed like a new language to me, just like coding. I took years learning and perfecting the sport.
Granted, I did make a lot of mistakes and that would make me pretty frustrated but after I got the hang of it,
I found it really rewarding and understood that I had to learn how to learn from my mistakes in order to improve.
And with that new found ability to learn how to learn, I was able to perform in competitions, and jump over fences, and
even teach other children how to ride. So with that, I'm here to coach others in the hardwork and dedication it takes
to learn how to learn and maybe one day I'll make a coding game about horseback riding!")
